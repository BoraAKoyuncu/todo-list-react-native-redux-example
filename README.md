# todo-list-react-native-redux-example
This is the Todo List example from Redux.js documentation, recreated in React Native during class. 

The Redux.js documentation runs with [a Todo List example](https://redux.js.org/basics/example-todo-list) in React. In the [Mobile Application Development](http://se.ieu.edu.tr/en/syllabus/type/read/id/SE+380) course that I teach, I recreated this example in React Native in a simpler way.

The code is intentionally kept simple and in one .js file, so that beginners can feel more at home.
